## TODO 

* Provide an  option in the UpDownPath to loop (or not to loop)
* Make the ship move as long as left or right key is pressed
* Make a separate meteor class, then make it change its image after every "n" updates 
* Make the meteor smaller
* Detect when meteor hits either the missile or the ship 
* Destroy a meteor (remove from world as well) if missile hits it
* Destropy the ship if meteor hits it 
* Initialize with different number of meteors , and speed. Might be fun to find 
different kinds of images for this.
* Put restrictions on how my misslies can be fired at any given time - may be a counter for delay.
* Add shield etc. you can keep on adding more stuff to game play 
* Experiment with different kind of paths
