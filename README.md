## What exists 

* The ship moves left and right.
* A single meteor comes down (goes in a loop) 
* Pressing the space bar shoots a missile (missles keep looping, are 
 never destroyed. 

## TODO 
### First priority 
* Make a separate meteor class.  
* Detect when meteor hits either the missile or the ship. 
* Destroy a meteor (remove from world as well) if missile hits it
* Destropy the ship if meteor hits it 
* Make the ship move as long as left or right key is pressed
* Put restrictions on how many misslies can be fired at any given time - may 
be a counter for delay.
### Extensions 
* Initialize with different number of meteors , and speed and even images. 
* Add shield etc. you can keep on adding more stuff to game play 
* Make the metor change its image after every "n" updates 
* Experiment with different kind of paths 
* Provide an  option in the UpDownPath to loop (or not to loop)
